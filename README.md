# Monty-Hall
Run statistical experiments on the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

Ever since this paradoxical puzzle came out in the 1970s, nearly everyone on Earth cannot accept its proposed solution as logical, with a very slow rate of people changing their minds and believing.  Have they gone mad?  Are we going insane?  Maybe a simulation by a program running experimental probability tests can help.
